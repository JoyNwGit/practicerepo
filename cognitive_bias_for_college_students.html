        <h1> Hello, World! </h1>
        <h2> These are some common cognitive biases you may experience at your time at UCSD.</h2>
        <h3> First I'll provide a picture reference and then give some UCSD (or college in general) examples. </h3>
        <img src="18-cognitive-bias-examples.jpg" height="30%" width="90%">
        <p>
            1. Anchoring Effect
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "I don't really know what I want to major in but I want to work and build computers. I'll do Electrical Engineering."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The UnOlympics was pretty fun when I was a freshman. I'm surprised so many people come out each year."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "I could handle several AP classes in High School. I should be able to handle 6 classes in college. I only have to attend a couple of them every day."
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Availability Heuristic
            <ul>
                <li>
                    **CONSTRUCTION ALERT**
                </li>
                <li>
                    "I may have had to drop ECE 35 the first time, but now I'm ready."
                </li>
                <li>
                    *When a class doesn't take the whole first day to read the syllabus like your High School classes* "What? No! I'm not ready for this!"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            3. BandWagon Effect
            <ul>
                <li>
                    University Meme pages. But I honestly can't complain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "6th college sucks and everyone there is a raccoon."
                </li>
                <li>
                    *Finals Week* "Ok. If I look at this objectively, everyone in this class is probably failing. I got 6 hours to study and all I gotta do is fail the least to pass."
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Belief bias
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "The curve will save me."
                </li>
                <li>
                    *After a campus tour* "So it seems the major buildings are lecture halls. It would make sense then that eventually I'll have class in Jacobs."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "UCSD isn't that easy to get into. Everyone here is probably a nerd."
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Blindspot bias
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "Warren College is Best College. It shouldn't take that many GEs to make a well-rounded student."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The professor said her midterm was perfectly fair because anything she'd ever said or was mentioned in the book can reasonably be expected on the exam. My GPA can't take anymore hits. I'm out."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "You're biased because you helped create and run the event. Fall Y'all is definitely not fun. It's just a bunch of noise when I'm trying to study!"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> 
            6. Clustering Illusion
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "This is the 4th assignment IN A ROW where that guy who is constantly struggling is doing better than me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or why this keeps happening!... Am I dumb...?"
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Hey look at that. I got higher than 70 on the first 2 assigments. Alright, I think I got this."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "I don't know what to tell you. All-nighters have been helping me actually finish my assignments on time. I just have to hold out until the end of finals. I can do it. Don't worry."
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
